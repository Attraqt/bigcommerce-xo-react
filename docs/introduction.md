# Attraqt-powered PLP

## High-level Approach

- This isn't designed to be drop in - you're in control of the UI
- This is a set of components that can use and follow as an example

## Component Approach

- Add a container component that uses the hoc with search and optionally the bigcommerce configuration hoc.
- Build out your UI bit by bit from that.
- There are prebuilt components that you can tap into for things like sort order, pagination, items grid, etc.
